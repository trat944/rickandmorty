**First questions to ask myself**

* How to start -> Should I fetch all three locations, characters and episodes and then work on them?
Or should I fetch episodes and then characters and locations from each episode when clicking on them?

* Should I start with HTML, fetching the APi? 

* Default container episode 1? 

* How to implement the fetch and the promise.All in typescript. 

* How to make the types of the objects fetched? Before? After?
