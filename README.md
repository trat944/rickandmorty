**First questions to ask myself**

* How to start -> Should I fetch all three locations, characters and episodes and then work on them?
Or should I fetch episodes and then characters and locations from each episode when clicking on them?

* Should I start with HTML, fetching the APi? 

* Default container episode 1? 

* How to implement the fetch and the promise.All in typescript. 

* How to make the types of the objects fetched? Before? After?


**First things to do**

* Get proper knowledge about TS.

* Make the interfaces in separate folder.

* Fetch all the episodes and divide into seasons. That will be the starting point of all. 

* Make the seasons button work and display in the main container the episode info.

* Then, fetch the characters of each episode the user clicks. 

**Big problems**

*  The way to get my characters of the episode. Solution: fetch them again(bad solution, but the one I got).
