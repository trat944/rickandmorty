## ⚡ Challenges

- **Fetching Data Dynamically:** Deciding whether to fetch all data upfront or fetch additional data based on user interactions posed challenges in optimizing data loading and application performance.
- **Managing Asynchronous Operations:** Coordinating asynchronous operations, especially when fetching data from multiple endpoints, required careful handling to ensure data consistency and prevent race conditions.
- **Event Listener Management:** Implementing event listeners for user interactions, such as clicking on characters or planets, required careful management to avoid memory leaks and ensure smooth navigation within the application.
